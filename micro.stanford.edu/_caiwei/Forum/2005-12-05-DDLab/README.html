History:
<p>
Release 2.3 (2006/10/29, Wei)<br>
        1. Added a few test cases and renamed a few files for consistency<br>
        2. Integrated with <a href="http://micro.stanford.edu/~caiwei/CSD-Book" target="blank_">web site</a>
           for the book <i>Computer Simulations of Dislocations</i>, Chapter 10. <br>
<p>

Release 2.2 <br>
        1. Bug fix since Release 1.1: function mindist change name to mindistcalc
           to avoid overlap with variable name mindist <br>
        2. Automatically compile SegSegForces.c before execution.  This will significantly speed
           up force calculation.  See dd3d.m. <br>

Release 1.1
